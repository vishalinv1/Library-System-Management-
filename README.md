# 📚 Library System Management

A comprehensive **Library Management System** project built using **PostgreSQL** for efficient handling of book inventory, library branches, employees, members, and book borrowing status.

This project demonstrates the use of relational databases with real-world schema design, SQL queries, and dataset management. Ideal for learning SQL fundamentals, database normalization, and data retrieval techniques.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to design schema
- Schema creation using SQL DDL (`Schema.sql`)
- Preloaded datasets in `.csv` format
- Sample SQL queries (`Queries.sql`) for common operations
- Clean, normalized design with foreign key relationships
- Use of PostgreSQL to manage relational data efficiently
